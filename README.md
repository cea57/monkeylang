## Writing and Interpreter in Go
This reposetory is the summation of my progress of building an interpreter of the Monkey Programming Language using the book: **Writing an Interpreter in Go** by Thorston Hall. I have some experience in C and I have never progrmamed in the Go Programming Language before. This will be a learning experience for me. If you have any comments or recommendations to help me, feel free to email me at cea57@cornell.edu. Thank you and enjoy!
